# 📊 Stock Price Time Series Analysis

This project is part of my **Codveda Technology Internship (Task 2)**.  
It applies **time series analysis** techniques to stock price data using Python to uncover trends, seasonality, and patterns.

## 🔹 Project Steps
- Data cleaning and parsing with **Pandas & NumPy**
- Visualization of stock prices using **Matplotlib**
- Calculation of short- and long-term **moving averages**
- **Time series decomposition** (trend, seasonality, residuals)
- Monthly resampling for long-term behavior

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Statsmodels  

## 📈 Key Results
- Visualized raw stock price movements  
- Identified **trends and seasonal components**  
- Compared short vs. long moving averages for market insights  
- Built a foundation for future **forecasting models**
